# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
- The Targets for my model ia the income vs. the ask amount. 
- Other variables considered are whether a company has backers, and more.
- Variales such as company name and ID number should be removed from the input data as they are neither targets nor features.
### Compiling, Training, & Evaluating the Model
- !5 neurons and 2 activation functions were used for the model at first, then more layers and neurons were added in an attempt to increase accuracy.
- I was unable to achieve 75% acuracy, I reached approximately 70% on my attempts.
- I added layers and neurons to try and improve level of accuracy.
## Summary
- Overall, the results were not what I was anticipating. I was unable to achieve 75% acuracy, I reached approximately 70% on my attempts.
